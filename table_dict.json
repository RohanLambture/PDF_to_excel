We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of DIXON TECHNOLOGIES (INDIA) LIMITED (\"the Company\") for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2023 (\"the Statement\"), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (\"the SEBI\") (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. This Statement which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") read with relevant Rules issued thereunder; and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.  2.  We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  3.  Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
